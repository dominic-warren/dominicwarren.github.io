<h1>Having your work shared</h1>



<p>I initially started my blog articles as an element of my portfolio. UX writing work is really hard to showcase, it certainly is different to visual design. But the articles are a way for me to show my thinking and what I’ve learnt.</p>



<p>However, it’s really nice and encouraging when you see people sharing them. Especially when those people are well-known across the industry or are people you admire.</p>



<p>One person who has shared my article, <a href="http://dominicwarren.com/posts/what-is-ux-writing">What is UX writing?</a>, is <a href="https://twitter.com/jmspool" target="_blank">Jared Spool</a>.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">As <a href="https://twitter.com/dominicwarren1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@dominicwarren1</a> explains, you can begin a project by writing a conversation between your design and your user. This exercise helps you determine what content you need in the design.<br><br>We’ll share this great resource with <a href="https://twitter.com/CenterCentre?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CenterCentre</a> students.<a href="https://t.co/eYzee4CjzW">https://t.co/eYzee4CjzW</a></p>&mdash; Jared Spool (@jmspool) <a href="https://twitter.com/jmspool/status/1159090570381418497?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<p>When I saw it, it’s safe to say, I was shocked. To have your work recognised and shared by someone with the influence and reach Spool does is really exciting. It’s also a great sense of validation — that proponents in the industry agree with what I think and write.</p>



<p>It’s also great that he’s shared it a number of times, quoting different parts of the article.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“One big area of difference between a UX writer and most other writing is how closely we work with designers.<br><br>It doesn’t make any sense to build a service or product and then drop words into it at the very end.”<br><br>— <a href="https://twitter.com/dominicwarren1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@dominicwarren1</a><a href="https://t.co/eYzee4CjzW">https://t.co/eYzee4CjzW</a></p>&mdash; Jared Spool (@jmspool) <a href="https://twitter.com/jmspool/status/1175999231309623301?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 23, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In this article, <a href="https://twitter.com/dominicwarren1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@dominicwarren1</a> explains how UX writers and designers benefit from working together from the beginning of a project.<br><br>It doesn’t make sense to build a product, then try to drop content in at the end.<a href="https://t.co/eYzee4CjzW">https://t.co/eYzee4CjzW</a></p>&mdash; Jared Spool (@jmspool) <a href="https://twitter.com/jmspool/status/1165755231830982657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 25, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>



<p>I was also really surprised when I received an issue of Ten Things, by <a href="https://twitter.com/La_Pope" target="_blank">Lauren Pope</a>. Under Thing 3 I found my own article, <a href="http://dominicwarren.com/posts/accepting-feedback" target="_blank">Don't be precious: accepting edits and feedback</a>, listed.</p>



<p><a href="https://us3.campaign-archive.com/?u=745f6a81d2d1e196c7d473704&id=4dc0429eb9" target="_blank">Lauren Pope’s Ten Things</a></p>



<p>Lauren is someone I’ve admired since I started in the industry. So to see my article listed on her newsletter is a great feeling.</p>



<p>Again, having your work recognised like this is wonderful. It’s one of the reasons I’m keen to share articles I like on <a href="https://twitter.com/dominicwarren1" target="_blank">my Twitter</a>. I might not have as many followers as some, but it’s a way for me to say I really enjoyed the article.</p>



<p>I'd really recommend <a href="https://mailchi.mp/b140ade59ab5/ten-things" target="_blank">signing up to Ten Things</a>. It's always full of interesting articles.</p>
