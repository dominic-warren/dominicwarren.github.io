<h1>How workplace language dehumanises</h1> 

<p>As content designers and UX writers, we&apos;re specialists in language. But it&apos;s not just the words we read and write that are important. Spoken language is crucial to understanding our users&apos; needs and what they do and don&apos;t understand.</p> 



<p>However the words we use internally, as an organisation, also has a huge impact. We can get bogged down in technical, business terms that do nothing but make us sound weird. Something I&apos;ve noticed is this is common with the way we talk about people.</p> 



<h2>Language that excludes</h2> 



<p>I&apos;ve worked in a few different industries, but the way we talk about people is similar. It&apos;s dehumanising. For some reason, managers can&apos;t talk about people as exactly that — people.</p> 



<p>I&apos;ve come across some examples like:</p> 

<ul> 

<li>resource</li> 

<li>capacity</li> 

<li>full time equivalent (FTE)</li> 

<li>band threes</li> 

</ul> 



<p>In some circumstances, talking about the “available capacity” makes sense. But a lot of the time it&apos;s used as a blanket term for individuals who do “the work”. This is the same with all these examples — it negatively reinforces hierarchy. It removes any personality and emotion from the individuals. It reduces them to nothing more than numbers on a spreadsheet.</p> 



<p>I&apos;m sure for a lot of companies, this is exactly why. When discussing and planning large amounts of people you&apos;ll use blanket terms for ease. However, this drip feeds down so that even team managers will use it when talking about 2 or 3 people. This use of language may not seem like a big deal, but we could easily define them as microaggressions. When these add up they can negatively impact team morale and how people value their work and input.</p> 



<h2>Speaking upwards and downwards</h2> 



<p>In my experience, this language is exclusively used for those who sit lower down on the organisational structure. When people talk about those above them they use more powerful language, like:</p> 

<ul> 

<li>Execs</li> 

<li>Directors</li> 

<li>The board</li> 

</ul> 



<p>This language isn&apos;t anymore sensitive to people as individuals. But it does resonate with power and authority. Again, this reinforces hierarchy.</p> 



<h2>Inclusive language</h2> 



<p>This reinforcement of hierarchy is typical of an old-style company. What we&apos;re seeing now is companies trying to reframe how they talk to their employees.</p> 



<p>For example, Google is famous for calling it&apos;s people Googlers. And they call their new employees Nooglers, combining ‘new&apos; with ‘Googler&apos;. While there&apos;s some differences between Nooglers and Googlers, this is more inclusive. It&apos;s easy to see how this tries to include you as part of the company and its culture.</p> 



<h2>Appreciate people</h2> 



<p>To motivate people, making their work feel meaningful, let&apos;s start by appreciating them. We can stop using language that removes their humanity and abilities — we&apos;re not ‘resources&apos;! — and start calling people ‘people&apos;. We can use each other&apos;s names and refer to ‘the team&apos; collectively. Let&apos;s be nice, friendly and helpful.</p> 



<p>Let&apos;s include everyone. It&apos;s not difficult.</p>
