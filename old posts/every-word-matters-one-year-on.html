<h1>every word matters: one year on</h1> 

<p>It&apos;s been a year to the day since I launched the publication <i><a href="http://medium.com/everywordmatters" target="_blank">every word matters</a></i>. I started not really knowing if it would be helpful or if I&apos;d even get interviews.</p> 



<p>Luckily, I can say the content design and UX writing industry is full of friendly, helpful and generous people. Everyone I asked was really supportive, whether they could take part or not. I was worried as I sent out email after email that asking the same questions to everyone would make for a repetitive, boring blog. What it&apos;s shown me is that everyone&apos;s experience is different. From the big questions, like getting into the industry, to the small questions, such as their top 3 apps, we can see such variety.</p> 



<p>I&apos;ve developed the questions as time has gone on. I&apos;ve updated them to match the growing list of interviewees and the different companies they work with. This has shown new ideas and thoughts. It&apos;s also made me think about what I&apos;d want to learn from our peers as I&apos;ve developed within the industry. I hope this is the same for my readers as well.</p> 



<p>As it hits one year I&apos;m happy to see the publication has over 500 followers, far more than I thought I&apos;d ever get. I&apos;m also really proud that the first article — <a href="https://medium.com/everywordmatters/john-saito-dropbox-ed55f0e08d1" target="_blank">John Saito, Dropbox</a> — has over 3,500 views!</p>

<p>Although it&apos;s slowed down, I&apos;m still approaching people and publishing interviews as I get them. So keep an eye out over 2019.</p> 



<p>What I&apos;ve found is this has also become a great body of work that I can show people. I&apos;ve talked about it with people at conferences and when interviewing for jobs. But, the main intention of this was to learn from my peers and make a resource for other people to learn from.</p> 



<p>I&apos;ve learnt a lot about my fellow Content Designers and UX Writers. We&apos;ve discussed the variety of routes into the job, the different companies that have writers and the principles behind them. I hope my audience has found <i>every word matters</i> helpful and learnt from it as well.</p> 



<p>I&apos;d also like to say <b>thank you</b> to everyone that&apos;s taken part so far! &#128079; <i>every word matters</i> couldn&apos;t exist without the great interviewees we&apos;ve featured so far.</p>
