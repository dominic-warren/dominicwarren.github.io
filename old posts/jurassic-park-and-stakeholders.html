<p>Dealing with stakeholders is notoriously one of the hardest parts of working in Digital. There are conflicting priorities and agendas that Digital, when making a product or service, need to bring together into some kind of consensus.</p> 

<p>There are plenty of Medium articles covering the techniques and skills you can use to work and collaborate with stakeholders more effectively. It&apos;s something I am definitely still exploring and learning about myself.</p> 

<p>The most obvious issue that happens across organisations and companies though is that stakeholders and project teams don&apos;t learn from past mistakes.</p> 



<h3>Jurassic Park</h3> 

<p>There&apos;s a theme park. Everyone gets attacked. Theme park gets destroyed.</p> 

<h3>The Lost World: Jurassic Park</h3> 

<p>New island discovered, new theme park is made. Everyone gets attacked.</p> 

<h3>Jurassic Park III</h3> 

<p>Everyone gets attacked. The island (pretty much) gets destroyed.</p> 

<h3>Jurassic World</h3> 

<p>New theme park. Everyone gets attacked. Theme park gets destroyed.</p> 

<h3>Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom</h3> 

<p>Probably a new theme park. Everyone probably gets attacked.</p> 



<p>Jurassic Park screams of a project that&apos;s had a lot of various stakeholder input at the end. Whoever&apos;s in charge of the many Jurassic Parks is not learning their lesson. And if it&apos;s different people starting new parks, they aren&apos;t looking at what their predecessors have done — and more importantly, what they did wrong.</p> 



<p>There&apos;s a saying that I hear a lot:</p> 



<p class="quote">“the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results” — (generally cited as Albert Einstein, although <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/03/23/same/" target="_blank">more likely one of the twelve-step communities</a>)</p> 



<p>Obviously this doesn&apos;t apply to every situation, but Jurassic Park is a great example. And when it comes to projects, if you repeat the same mistakes, the results certainly won&apos;t change.</p> 



<p>When working on projects, it&apos;s best to keep stakeholders to a minimum. If there&apos;s lots of teams that need to have input, they could have a delegate who&apos;s trusted to make those decisions. By working with other teams you&apos;ll understand the difficulties they had before.</p> 



<p>But, it&apos;s not just what went wrong or went badly. It&apos;s what they did to overcome it, what they did to fix it, and what they did to make it better.</p>
